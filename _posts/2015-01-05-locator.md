Building mobile apps often requires working with location information. While, the Cordova geo-location plugin makes it quite trivial to get the latitude and longitude values for the userâ€™s current location, what we often want is location identifiers that are meaningful to the user - and not necessarily corresponding to the place where the user is right now. Below we look at two ways at acquiring meaningful location identifiers.

## 1. Geo-Location to Nearby Locations
We fetch nearby locations based on the geo-location data and allow the user to pick the most appropriate option. For this method we can split the tasks into two services:

### Location
The [Location service](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/locator/blob/master/src/location-picker/services/location.js) checks to see if geo-location is available and grabs the current location. It also allows us to register *on-ready-tasks* with it. Therefore, all the other directives/services which depend on the geo-location data only bootstrap once the data is available.

The geo-location data is captured using using the `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` method. This works for both desktop browsers and Cordova/PhoneGap.

### Reverse Geocoder
Reverse geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates (like latitude 43.647118 and longitude -79.420194) into a human-readable address (such as Ossington Ave at Argyle St, Toronto, ON, M6J 2Z5).

The [Reverse Geocoder](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/locator/blob/master/src/location-picker/services/reverse-geocoder.js) sets up the [Google Geocoder service](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#Geocoder) and uses the geo-location data to fetch, reverse geocoded, nearby locations. The service provides various options with reducing resolution, for example:

- House #, Street, City, Province, Postal Code, Country
- Street, City, Province, Postal Code, Country
- Neighbourhood, City, Province, Country
- City, Province, Postal Code, Country

### Location-Picker
The [Location-Picker](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/locator/blob/master/src/location-picker/directives/location-picker.js) packages this into a simple directive. It utilizes the `reverse-geocoder` service to fetch a set of options for the user. The user selection is then bound to the object passed in through the `ng-model` attribute.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Requires access to the user's geo-location data -->
<location-picker
    ng-model="pickedLocation"
    limit-to="5"></location-picker>
{% endhighlight %}


## 2. Manually Query the Location Database
The second method is to allow the user to query the location database manually. In this case we use a set of nested directives and the [Google Auto-complete service](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete).

### Location-Predictions
[Location-Predictions directive](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/locator/blob/master/src/location-lookup/directives/location-predictions-directive.js) generates a search box and sets up the Google Auto-complete service. The auto-complete service fetches predictions based on the user submitted query string.

### Location-Lookup
The location-predictions directive generates a set of options which are passed into the [Location-Lookup directive](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks/locator/blob/master/src/location-lookup/directives/location-lookup-directive.js). Which in turn displays them as a list for the user to choose from. Once the user picks a location it uses the [Google Places service](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places) to fetch the geo-location data for it.

{% highlight html %}
<!-- Requires user to enter a query -->
<location-lookup
    ng-model="lookedUpLocation"
    limit-to="4"></location-lookup>
{% endhighlight %}

The Google Places Library has certain [logo requirements](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#LogoRequirements). In this case we are not using a map therefore, we are required to display a **Powered by Google** logo along with the data.

## Usage
Both, location-lookup and location picker, directives are fairly straight forward to use. They essentially behave as a `<select>` element. The selection is captured using `ng-model`. Optionally you can limit the number of choices by using the `limit-to` attribute.

The selection returns data of the following type:

{% highlight js %}
{
    name: 'CN Tower',
    description: 'CN Tower, Front Street West, Toronto, ON, Canada',
    latitude: 43.642566,
    longitude: -79.38705700000003
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Alternative Geocoding Providers
In this example I've used [Google Maps JavaScript API v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript) for all the location services required. Depending on your business and/or technical needs this might not be the best option. However, the idea remains the same and you could swap out the Google services with your prefered alternative.
