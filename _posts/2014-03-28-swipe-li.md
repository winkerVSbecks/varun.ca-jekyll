Recently we &ndash; at  [rangle.io](http://rangle.io) &ndash; had a chance to work on a short project. The app was largely a functional prototype built in 1 week. One of the requirements was to build an interface to allow the user to quickly accept or reject items. We came up with **swipe-li**: a three pane swipeable `<li>` element. Swipe right for accept. Swipe left for reject.

<!--more-->

Most of the *swiping* code is taken from the  [hammer.js](http://hammerjs.github.io/) carousel example. To support the directive I built a **hammerRemote** service. This delegate service allows you to register/destroy/control multiple instances of hammer.

{% highlight html %}
<div
  swipe-li
  disabled=""
  intent="true"
  accept="done(item)"
  reject="skip(item)"
  main-content="'sample-content.html'"
  accept-content="'accept-content.html'"
  reject-content="'reject-content.html'"
  reset-to-content="false"
></div>
{% endhighlight %}

Where:

- `disabled`: disable the swipe-li element
- `intent`: user intent detection, if the user drags the pane > 50% of the width - the swipe will auto complete
- `accept`: accept callback
- `reject`: reject callback
- `main-content`: template for the start pane
- `accept-content`: template for the accept pane
- `reject-content`: template for the reject pane
- `reset-to-content`: should the swiped pane reset back to start pane on complete
