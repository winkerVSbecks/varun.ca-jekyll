I wanted to replicate CreativeDash's open &amp; close animation with pure CSS/SASS, but don't think it's possible without SVG path animations. This is the closest I got.

Kyle Henwood wrote a great [blog post](https://raygun.io/blog/2014/07/making-svg-html-burger-button) on how to build this with SVG.

Also, Anders Ingemann's tutorial &ndash; [Radial progress indicator using CSS](https://medium.com/@andsens/radial-progress-indicator-using-css-a917b80c43f9) &ndash; was really helpful in trying to figure out the circular mask.
