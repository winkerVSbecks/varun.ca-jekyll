If you have the `Enable experimental Web Platform features` flag set as `enabled` in Chrome you might have been noticed that *interweb* has been acting pretty weird. Here are some of the issues I encountered:

- Almost all the UI for  [rdio](http://rdio.com/) just vanished.  [see more info]( http://help.rdio.com/customer/en/portal/questions/5094222-ui-disappearing-ui-elements?new=5094222)

- FontAwesome animations stopped working  [Issue #2490 @ github/fontawesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/2490)

- CSS Key Frame Animation stopped working in general  [Issue 331261 @ chromium](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=331261)

- Twitter/Twipster modal kept dissapperaing and re-appearing  [Issue #36 @github/Twipster](https://github.com/jxnblk/Twipster/issues/36)
