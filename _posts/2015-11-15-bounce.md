When creating motion one must think about the object that needs to be animated. Pick a style of motion that best fits its personality. The Google Material Design spec has a section on [Authentic Motion](https://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html) which summarizes this quite aptly:

> Just as the shape of an object indicates how it might behave, watching an object move demonstrates whether it’s light, heavy, flexible, rigid, small or large. In the world of material design, motion describes spatial relationships, functionality, and intention with beauty and fluidity.

One of the core aspects of these *styles* is easing. The pen below shows the same box moving across the screen. The only difference is the type of easing used. Box **(1)** has the default linear easing while **(2)** has a *swift-out* easing (`cubic-bezier(0.55, 0, 0.1, 1);`). Clearly **(2)** has a lot more character.

There are several types of easings – [easings.net](http://easings.net) has an exhaustive list. The one I want to focus on specifically is *bounce*. Also known as elastic easing. Let’s look at a few techniques to achieve elastic easing.

## 1. Cubic Bezier

Using the CSS cubic-bezier timing function we can generate some basic elastic easings. For example `cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55)` produces the following effect.

Cubic-bezier is a type of smooth [parametric curve](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/parametric_equations/parametric/v/parametric-equations-1) which defines the animation of a property between two states. The curve itself is similar to the vector curves in Illustrator/Sketch except limited to 2 points with one handle each.

Since it’s a unit curve the start and end positions are always the same: `(0, 0)` &amp; `(1, 1)`. This allows the curve to scale to the animation duration. The most important part here is the shape of the curve. The shape is defined by the position of the handles.

```css
/**
 * Cubic Bezier Timing Function
 * (x1, y1): location of P1
 * (x2, y2): location of P2
 */
cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)
```

You might notice a limitation here. For a *true* bounce effect – where the object bounces and few times before finally coming to a slow stop – the motion curve needs to be of the type shown in **Fig. 3**. To create such a curve you would require much more than just two points. The CSS cubic-bezier curve is limited to two points. Therefore, you are limited to one bounce in the start and one in the end (see the **Pen 2** above for an example).

## 2. Keyframe Animation

One way we can replicate this  *true* bounce motion is using keyframes. We map the motion curve to a keyframe timeline. You can do this with JS, Sass, PostCSS, etc. I previously wrote a post about how to generate [custom easing with Sass](/custom-easing-with-sass). You can follow the exact same process and use a bounce easing function. For example:

```scss
// Bounce Function
// t is the current time (or position) of the tween.
// b is the beginning value of the property.
// c is the change between the beginning and destination value of the property.
// d is the total time of the tween.
@function bounce(t, b, c) {

  d: 100;
  ts: (t / d) * t;
  tc: ts * t;

  @return b + c * (33 * tc * ts + -106 * ts * ts + 126 * tc
    + -67 * ts + 15 * t);
}
```

While you can do this manually there is a much easier way. [Bounce.js](http://bouncejs.com/#{l:1,s:[{T:"t",e:"b",d:2000,D:1000,f:{x:-300,y:0},t:{x:150,y:0},s:3,b:8}]}) is an awesome library that generates CSS for such complex motion. This is an example of the kind of output you can expect from their web based tool and you can see it in action in **Pen 3** below. Oh, and it’s using CSS transforms so you get great performance too. Pretty awesome!

```css
.animation-target {
  animation: animation 3000ms linear infinite both;
}

## 3. Equations of Motion With JS

The Sass/Bounce.js combo works amazing 99% of the time but, sometimes you want a little bit more flexibility. The CSS is generated in advance and doesn’t respond dynamically to the user interaction. For example, the scroll bounce on iOS. The magnitude of the bounce and number of oscillations before the animation stops depends on the speed of the scrolling. Something like this can’t be hard-coded. You want the animation to be generated on the fly.

My favourite way to do this is using some high-school physics.
